#+title:   BASE_DIR detection

* Requirements

Do not require invoking scripts (or users from command lines) to set
the $PATH to include the directory where source-able (meaning using
the "." operator) utility Bourne shell scripts live.  This is so as
to allow other users that do not have the current users $HOME/bin
directory in their path to simply invoke 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/home/thisuser/bin/something.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

such that something.sh should be able to detect that directory:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/home/thisuser/bin/
#+END_EXAMPLE

and use it as the base directory for sourcing via:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
. $BASE_DIR/some_other_utility_file.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

BASE_DIR needs to be determined to allow scripts such as
some_other_utility_file.sh to refer to other files (hence it cannot
simply be put into the PATH).

Allow for the case where we have multiple directories, each of which
need to refer to files in those directories in their scripts
$BASE_DIR, so we cannot export BASE_DIR into the environment.

* Troubles with basing sourced Bourne shell utility files

Suppose we source a Bourne shell file called
some_other_utility_file.sh like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
. some_directory_path_here/some_other_utility_file.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

The key constraint here is that some_other_utility_file.sh is not in
a directory located in the PATH. Suppose also that, inside
some_other_utility_file.sh, we wish to determine the directory where
some_other_utility_file.sh is located, and in this case, that
directory happens to be "some_directory_path_here/".

This happens when sourcing the file from a script in another
directory. 

* Current workaround to the above problem:

Arrange for the ~/.profile (and all invoking scripts that are going
to be executed versus sourced) to set a variable called BASE_DIR to
point to the directory where some_other_utility_file.sh lives. Then
source the files in that directory via:

  . $BASE_DIR/some_other_utility_file.sh

We cannot simply add BASE_DIR to the PATH since
some_other_utility_file.sh may need to refer to files inside
$BASE_DIR.

Detect when BASE_DIR is not set and if it is then use this heuristic
to determine it. BASE_DIR should never be exported into the
environment because that would defeat the purpose of allowing different
BASE_DIR values for scripts in different directories:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
if [ -z "$BASE_DIR" ]
then
  # Find the base directory while avoiding subtle variations in $0:
  dollar0=`which $0`;
  BASE_DIR=`dirname $dollar0` # NEVER export BASE_DIR
fi
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Reusable code snippets

** Code snippet to use in executable scripts

Scripts executed, not sourced (via "." operator):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Find the base directory while avoiding subtle variations in $0:
dollar0=`which $0`; BASE_DIR=`dirname $dollar0`
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Code snippet to use in source-able scripts

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
if [ -z "$BASE_DIR" ]; then echo "ASSERTION FAILED: Calling script always has to dynamically determine and set the BASE_DIR variable."; exit 1 ; fi # see ./base_dir_detect.org
#+END_EXAMPLE
