* Building Emacs

 1. [ ] Build and locally install packages that ./linux/build.bash
    currently requires from the system, since that deviates from the
    intent of the build-locally system. See the notes in the comments
    inside ./linux/build.bash. Namely, re-examine the hardcoded
    --without-gif and with-tiff options to configure.
 2. [ ] Re-enable building with svg. Currently disabled due to its complex
    dependencies.
