sqlite3
=======

Parent: [build-locally](../../README.md)

Builds the sqlite3 package. See [sqlite home page](http://www.sqlite.org/)

See [TODO Org file](TODO.org) for pending TODO items.

The www directory from the Debian source package is installed into
$INSTALL_DIR/share/sqlite3/www/. Under that directory I found
keyword_index.html quite helpful.

The manpage is installed into the standard location at $INSTALL_DIR/man/man1/sqlite3.1
