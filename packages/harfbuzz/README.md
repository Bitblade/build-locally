harfbuzz
========

Parent: [build-locally](../../README.md)

Builds the harfbuzz package. See [harfbuzz home page](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/)

See also [linux from scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/harfbuzz.html)

It says: "You need to install ragel... See http://www.complang.org/ragel/"

[linux from scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/harfbuzz.html) did not say anything about that.

Ran into a strange build failure documented at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25965189/ragel-does-not-preserve-lines-beginning-with-pound-sign-characters-in-betwee
