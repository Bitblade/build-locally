#+title:    TODO Org file for building python--readline
#+author:   Brent Goodrick
#+STARTUP:  hideblocks

* Overview

This is the detailed Org mode file to track todo items and design
notes for the build-locally project, but specifically for building the
readline package of Python. Items marked as TODO are yet to do. See
the ../../README.md file for end-user usage.

* DONE Install readline

Create a python--readline package and install it via tips found at
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7375545/ipython-complaining-about-readline
(but that is MacOS-specific and right now we have not consider that platform).

The new "hotness" is pip as explained in
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install

And we see 
http://guide.python-distribute.org/installation.html#pip-installs-python-pip says:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The pip application is a replacement for easy_install. It uses mostly the same techniques for finding packages, so
packages that were made easy_installable should be pip-installable as well.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Therefore try using pip.
